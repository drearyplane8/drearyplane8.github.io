        <p>The Sheffield Supertram has three routes, Blue, Yellow, and Purple, and the Tram-Train.
            The Yellow Route terminates at <a href="#middlewood">Middlewood</a> and
            <a href="#meadowhall">Meadowhall Interchange</a>, and the Blue Route at <a href="#malin-bridge">
                Malin Bridge</a> and <a href="#halfway">Halfway</a>. The Purple and Tram-Train services
            both start in the city centre at <a href="#cathedral">Cathedral</a>, with the Purple
            ending at <a href="#herdings-park">Herdings Park</a>, and the Tram-Train going onto
            National Rail to make it to <a href="#rotherham">Rotherham Central.</a>

                <p>
                    Middlewood is the northern terminus of the Yellow Line, out past Hillsborough. It has a single
                    line for trams to park next to the roadway, with space for two trams to sit in line.
                    The tram line runs along Middlewood Road A6102, but deviates off it for terminating trams.
                    This terminating point is before, but a short walk from, the town of Middlewood, which is more
                    or less the edge of the built-up Sheffield area, although linear settlement continues along
                    the A6102.

                <p>
                    If you're on board a Yellow Route tram, the stop will be referred to as Middlewood Park & Ride,
                    and Middlewood does not disappoint - a reasonably large car park awaits you, with free parking.
                    There seems to be no rule that you have to use it a park-and-ride, I suppose you could walk
                    into Hillsborough or Middlewood.
                </p>

                    I visited it around 12pm on a clear, sunny Sunday in October.

                        This flyer is accurate to what's going on - bus services are being cut,
                        and tram fares are increasing. The response of the authorities seems to be blame-shifting: from
                        the City Counil to the South Yorkshire Combined Authority, to Westminster.

                    Overall, Middlewood seems to do its job as a small park-and-ride well, people were using it as such,
                    even on a quiet Sunday lunchtime. It seems a logical place to end the line, with room to constructed
                    the siding necessary, although there isn't much to do up there but wait for the tram back - most
                    people have got off already. It does serve some nearby low-rise council blocks,
                    as well as more suburban residential developments across the road.

                <p>Herdings Park is the terminus of the Purple Route. It's situated in south-west Sheffield, in
                    Herdings Park (yes, in).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I visited in a cold sunny winter's Friday, at about 14:45.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Purple Route is the least frequent of Sheffield's tram routes, running once an hour! on
                    weekdays and Saturdays, and twice an hour on a Sunday. It starts at Cathedral, and parallels
                    the Blue Route as far as White Lane, where it continues a short while along A6102 Norton Road, 
                    before branching off onto a single-track alignment, where it runs along the boundary of 
                    Herdings Park on dedicated ballasted track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The combination of the very low frequency, and the track running in the park creates a strange
                    situation where walking on and around the tracks feels very safe. Luckily, walking on track
                    ballast is very uncomfortable.

                <p>
                    One of my favourite things about Sheffield is how you will get suprised by views when
                    you least expect it. You can see the whole city from this bus stop, and my phone camera
                    doesn't do it justice, especially with weather like this, it was incredible. The large grey
                    building centre-frame is the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, for orientation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second picture, you can see the buses which supplement the infrequent trams for people heading
                    into the city. It's a very scenic bus stop, and I could have pulled off the artsy shot a lot
                    better if I wanted to embed rocks and triangular steel into my stomach. This was taken from
                    behind the buffer stop - no Lottas were put in harm's way.

                <p>
                    The Purple Route - why so infrequent? I don't know, I'm not Stagecoach,
                    nor Travel South Yorkshire. It seems like there's only one tram that runs the route, and
                    presumably, two on Sundays. There is more stock available on a Sunday, since other routes run
                    less frequently, but equally, every time I've gone past the depot, they've had trams in bed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps it's lack of drivers which prevents them running more frequent
                    service. Either way, it feels like a big waste, to spend all that money on tram infrastructure to
                    run a service less intensive than the busses. I suppose the Purple does provide extra capacity 
                    on most of the Blue Route, however, the tram-tree-tunnel into a park is too lovely not to use more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, Herdings Park is a nice little park with an unusual but lovely tramway, although it's
                    not especially tranquil, due to the main road. The stop also could serve the residents of Herdings,
                    which is reasonably dense council development. It could, however, really do with more frequency.

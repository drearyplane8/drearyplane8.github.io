    <p>The Sheffield Supertram has three routes, Blue, Yellow, and Purple, and the Tram-Train.
        The Yellow Route terminates at <a href="#middlewood">Middlewood</a> and
        <a href="#meadowhall">Meadowhall Interchange</a>, and the Blue Route at <a href="#malin-bridge">
            Malin Bridge</a> and <a href="#halfway">Halfway</a>. The Purple and Tram-Train services
        both start in the city centre at <a href="#cathedral">Cathedral</a>, with the Purple
        ending at <a href="#herdings-park">Herdings Park</a>, and the Tram-Train going onto
        National Rail to make it to <a href="#rotherham">Rotherham Central.</a>

            Middlewood is the northern terminus of the Yellow Line, out past Hillsborough. It has a single
            line for trams to park next to the roadway, with space for two trams to sit in line.
            The tram line runs along Middlewood Road A6102, but deviates off it for terminating trams.
            This terminating point is before, but a short walk from, the town of Middlewood, which is more
            or less the edge of the built-up Sheffield area, although linear settlement continues along
            the A6102.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're on board a Yellow Route tram, the stop will be referred to as Middlewood Park & Ride,
            and Middlewood does not disappoint - a reasonably large car park awaits you, with free parking.
            There seems to be no rule that you have to use it a park-and-ride, I suppose you could walk
            into Hillsborough or Middlewood.

            I visited it around 12pm on a clear, sunny Sunday in October.

            <figcaption>
                This flyer is sadly evocative of what's going on around Sheffield - bus services are being cut,
                and tram fares increasing. The response of the authorities seems to be blame-shifting: from
                the City Counil to the South Yorkshire Combined Authority, to Westminster.

            <figcaption>This isn't a low shot for artistic effect, moreso that SYMCA is allergic to putting

            Overall, Middlewood seems to do its job as a small park-and-ride well, people were using it as such,
            even on a quiet Sunday lunchtime. It seems a logical place to end the line, with room to constructed
            the siding necessary, although there isn't much to do up there but wait for the tram back - most
            people have got off already. It does serve some nearby low-rise council blocks,
            as well as more suburban residential developments across the road.

                After accidentally getting the tram to Malin Bridge, and taking some pictures to augment my
                <a href="supertram-end-of-the-line.html#malin-bridge">end-of-the-line entry</a>, I decided
                to explore the area a little bit. Turns out, there was quite a lot to see &ndash; nature and 
                post-industrial waste (what else is there in Sheffield)?

                Please note - on this page, I am testing a new thumbnailing systems. Images should load in a 
                smaller size, and you can click on them to see a full-size version.

                The first thing I found going out down the road is an abandoned factory. Of course I had to
                investigate.

                        Don't suppose this door has been used in a while. Am I going insane,
                        or is this British Rail font?

                        Helpfully saving me from a rabbit-hole of "who owned this site?". Also making sure I know
                        what city I'm in? Very good sign.

            <p>
                I had a peek through the slats of the door to see what else I could discern about the site, and it clearly
                hadn't seen use in some time. I did have to ask, however, what exactly "EX" meant. My mind went to explosives,
                which is certainly a fun explanation.

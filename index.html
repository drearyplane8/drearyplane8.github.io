            <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Lottie, and this is my website. There's not a lot to see here at the moment, but more will come.
            </p>
            <p>
                Above, or on your right, you should find the sidebar containing Goodies, which are little 
                interactive widgets and thingymajigs I am hosting here, as well as the Blogs
                column, where I am liable to write about whatever takes my fancy, but it'll most 
                likely be food, trains, and perhaps my bad opinions. You've no obligation to
                read them, I just didn't want to re-learn Wordpress as well as CSS. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the website should look passable on mobile now!

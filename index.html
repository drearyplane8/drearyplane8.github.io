            <h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Lottie, and this is my website. There's not a lot to see here at the moment, but more will likely come. For now, you can gaze upon my attempts to
                make my website deviating as little as possible from the '90s-era HTML which I learnt ten years ago. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On your right you should find the sidebar containing Goodies, which are little interactive widgets and thingymajigs I am hosting here, as well as the Blogs
                column, where I am liable to write about whatever takes my fancy, but it'll most likely be food, trains, and my bad opinions. You've no obligation to
                read them, I just didn't want to re-learn Wordpress as well as CSS. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The website looks like ass on mobile! Eventually, a re-design will come.
